# Project analysis

## Target user

The target user is anyone who can be interested in working with me or hire me.

## Information architecture

This CV has a single webpage structured in two clearly distinct sections, one containing contact and general information and the other being more specific.

## Visual design

For the visual design, I've looked at a bunch of CVs and I have taken inspiration on some of them. The final webpage consists of a lateral bar with contact and general information alongside with a "photo" of myself (I don't feel comfortable putting a personal photo there), a main section with information about my work experience, studies, languages I speak and others, and a simple footer indicating that I have made this webpage. The color scheme was made by me using *Coolors* and consists of white and some varieties of blue. Finally, to make it all look nicer and more readable, different parts of information are separated by horizontal lines. 

# Figma

Before starting to code the website, I made a simple *Figma* page covering the key aspects I had in mind so I could have some guidelines.
